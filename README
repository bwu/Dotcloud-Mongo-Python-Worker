This application was created to get to know a few Dotcloud Services so that I could implement a
larger dotcloud project. The application uses two services, the mongodb database service and
the python worker service.

The application was designed to connect to a mongo database hosted on Dotcloud and record the
time and date into the database at one minute intervals. I tried to make the application as simple
as possible, to focus on understanding on the different services rather than creating something
actionable.
